What does it do?

Description ...

"Any IRI or literal denotes something in the world (the "universe of discourse"). These things are called resources.
Anything can be a resource, including physical things, documents, abstract concepts, numbers and strings; the term is
synonymous with "entity" as it is used in the RDF Semantics specification [RDF11-MT]. The resource denoted by an IRI
is called its referent, and the resource denoted by a literal is called its literal value. Literals have datatypes
that define the range of possible values, such as strings, numbers, and dates. Special kind of literals,
language-tagged strings, denote plain-text strings in a natural language."
