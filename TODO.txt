- API controller: templating
-- list
--- html: as RDFa
--- json-ld
--- nt
-- show
--- html (API links to rdf:Class, rdf:Property, rdfs:label, rdfs:comment) => as RDFa
--- json-ld
--- nt
--- ttl

- add ViewHelpers
-- RemoveEmptyLines
-- Trim

- create ext_tables_static+adt.sql for rdf/rdfs

- BE: add all rdf datatypes according to 2014 W3C https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema

- think about term & vocabulary data model: namespace/iri for term? vocab?

- term plugin

- vocabulary plugin

- think about statements in records => BE interface etc.

- check type param rewriting in TYPO3 9.5

- documentation

---

id=123 => rewritten by realurl to 'id' or whatever (= pagePath)
&tx_lod_api%5Bsubject%5D=1995 => rewritten by realurl to /id/value (= fixedPostVars)
&type=2004 => rewritten by realUrl to about.xyz (= fileName)

&tx_lod_about%5Baction%5D=about => skipped (by initializeAction and fixedPostVars)
&tx_lod_about%5Bcontroller%5D=Api skipped (by initializeAction and fixedPostVars)
&tx_lod_about%5Bformat%5D=rdfxml => ignored/suppressed (by initialize Action; switch is by pageType)

&cHash => skipped (by realUrl config)

/id/I385

/id/I385/about.html

/id.html

/id/about.rdf?tx_lod_api[offset]=1&tx_lod_api[limit]=100

- api plugin
-- think about cacheable actions => configurable cHash calculation during redirection => check performance
-- think about content negotiation service and move logic from controller
-- remaining todos in controller

- resolver
-- call different typolink handlers according to $representation->getAuthority();
-- implement language negotiation

---

scheme = handler type => t3 triggers internal resolving
authority = handler keyword
path = typolink parameter
query = additionalParams
fragment = section

- transfer stuff from CVMA to vocabulary ext

- switch wizard_add to 'script' and test editing

- vocabulary
-- is the tablename field really needed since prepend_tname doesn't have any effect?
-- first test with statements for any record
--- check how hard it is to integrate a makeLodifiable => quite hard, integrated later (@see CategoryRegistry)

- default templates for
-- showSelectedTerms
-- showSelectedVocabulary

- create new wizards at predicate + subject selects in statement table
- create new wizard at possibly all select fields

- RDF serializer => condense statements in RDF/XML + TTL output

- write some helpful repository methods to retrieve values from s/p/o's
-- maybe from a view helper?

- IDEA: create extension with full schema.org vocab (static info)
