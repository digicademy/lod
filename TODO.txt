## NEXT #########################################

- Fix Classes
-- table mapping => tx_lod_domain_model_namespace => IriNamespace
-- s,p,o mapping in class Statement

- should API controller only care about IRI type class?

- about plugin
-- add basic templates (nt, json-ld, rdf, ttl, xmp, xml)

- add needed ViewHelpers

- test with 76.t3xdev

---

id=123 => rewritten by realurl to 'id' or whatever (= pagePath)
&tx_lod_api%5Bsubject%5D=1995 => rewritten by realurl to /id/value (= fixedPostVars)
&type=2004 => rewritten by realUrl to about.xyz (= fileName)

&tx_lod_about%5Baction%5D=about => skipped (by initializeAction and fixedPostVars)
&tx_lod_about%5Bcontroller%5D=Api skipped (by initializeAction and fixedPostVars)
&tx_lod_about%5Bformat%5D=rdfxml => ignored/suppressed (by initialize Action; switch is by pageType)

&cHash => skipped (by realUrl config)

/id/I385

/id/I385/about.html

/id.html

/id/about.rdf?tx_lod_api[offset]=1&tx_lod_api[limit]=100

- api plugin
-- think about cacheable actions => configurable cHash calculation during redirection => check performance
-- think about content negotiation service and move logic from controller
-- remaining todos in controller

- resolver
-- call different typolink handlers according to $representation->getAuthority();
-- implement language negotiation

---

scheme = handler type => t3 triggers internal resolving
authority = handler keyword
path = typolink parameter
query = additionalParams
fragment = section

## TYPO3 8.7

# standard record link configuration from T3 V8 and higher

#				authority {

#				}
#			}

			t3 {
				# the t3 scheme implements the TYPO3 linkhandler (from 8.7 onwards but with backwards comp. for 7.6)
				# each authority equals / can have it's own linkhandler (=linkhander keyword)
				# the record authority implements the generic record linkhandler
				record < config.recordLinks.image

- Add new type Resource Representation for object?
-- use for 303 redirect to html?

- transfer stuff from CVMA to vocabulary ext

- switch wizard_add to 'script' and test editing

- vocabulary
-- is the tablename field really needed since prepend_tname doesn't have any effect?
-- first test with statements for any record
--- check how hard it is to integrate a makeLodifiable => quite hard, integrated later (@see CategoryRegistry)

- default templates for
-- showSelectedTerms
-- showSelectedVocabulary

- create new wizards at predicate + subject selects in statement table
- create new wizard at possibly all select fields

- RDF serializer => condense statements in RDF/XML + TTL output

- write some helpful repository methods to retrieve values from s/p/o's
-- maybe from a view helper?

- FLUID
-- generate namespaces in template dynamically from all used

- IDEA: create extension with full schema.org vocab (static info)
