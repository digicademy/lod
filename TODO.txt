- BE: add all rdf datatypes according to 2014 W3C https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema
-- object data templates => add language tags and data types
-- comment field => multiline / type text

- iri => should have statements irre field => create triples for resource

- transform term => graph (set of triples with a uri)
-- add IRI/Bnode field that denotes each graph record (mandatory)
-- irre field => foreign field is the context
-- offer named graphs over API (maybe next version)? => maybe this already works
-- skip label and comment fields; set title to uri/bnode + label field;

- create DataBase Hook / Handler that creates IRIs when creating records
-- tables configurable with TS
-- setting if IRIs should be deleted if records are deleted
-- think about hidden settings

- create ext_tables_static+adt.sql for rdf/rdfs

- API plugin
-- basic string search in label/comment for API plugin (list view)
-- IriRepository: make ordering settable by TypoScript/Plugin/Parameter (label/value)

- term plugin => delete?

- vocabulary plugin
- a vocabulary consists of a selection of named graphs

- think about statements in records
-- give example for embedding JSON-LD in pages (or any other record) output (triples retrieved by record assignment)

- check type param rewriting in TYPO3 9.5

- documentation

- create extension with schema.org vocab

- patterns
-- think about "patterns" that will create sets of triples on save of graph record (maybe next version?)
-- maybe a record is a "fixed pattern"?
-- or maybe a flexform approach?

---

id=123 => rewritten by realurl to 'id' or whatever (= pagePath)
&tx_lod_api%5Bsubject%5D=1995 => rewritten by realurl to /id/value (= fixedPostVars)
&type=2004 => rewritten by realUrl to about.xyz (= fileName)

&tx_lod_about%5Baction%5D=about => skipped (by initializeAction and fixedPostVars)
&tx_lod_about%5Bcontroller%5D=Api skipped (by initializeAction and fixedPostVars)
&tx_lod_about%5Bformat%5D=rdfxml => ignored/suppressed (by initialize Action; switch is by pageType)

&cHash => skipped (by realUrl config)

/id/I385

/id/I385/about.html

/id.html

/id/about.rdf?tx_lod_api[offset]=1&tx_lod_api[limit]=100

- api plugin
-- think about cacheable actions => configurable cHash calculation during redirection => check performance
-- think about content negotiation service and move logic from controller
-- remaining todos in controller

- resolver
-- call different typolink handlers according to $representation->getAuthority();
-- implement language negotiation

---

authority = handler keyword
path = typolink parameter
query = additionalParams

- switch wizard_add to 'script' and test editing

- default templates for
-- showSelectedTerms
-- showSelectedVocabulary

- create new wizards at predicate + subject selects in statement table
- create new wizard at possibly all select fields
- ensure new wizards are configurable by TSConfig
